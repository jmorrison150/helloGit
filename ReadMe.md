Tools for Rhino3d.
Using Grasshopper, C#, and Python


To make a custom command, save the python script in the folder 
%USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\McNeel\Rhinoceros\5.0\Plug-ins\PythonPlugins\CustomName\dev\
and include _cmd.py at the end of the filename.

now your script can be called from the command line. Pretty Cool.
